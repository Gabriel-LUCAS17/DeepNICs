# ROP-Training.

## Description.

* dataGenerationROP.R: generate filesystem containing ROP-Training samples.
* Batch-ROP-Training.bat: launch ROP-Training on the generated samples.

## Installation.

RStudio needed to launch the R script.

## How to use ?

**First Case.** The filesystem of ROP-Training samples is not yet generated :

1. Open dataGenerationROP.R in RStudio.
2. Change value of variable "referenceWD" : working directory.
3. Change value of variable "dataPath" : path towards data .csv file.
4. Change value of other parameters (number of trees, ...).
5. Run R program.

**Second Case.** The filesystem of ROP-Training samples is already generated :

1. Open cmd.exe.
2. Change the current working directory.
3. Enter the command : "Batch-ROP-Training.bat arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4 arg5" (see script documentation for usage).

## Remarks on Batch-ROP-Training.

* **Dependency.** "Batch-ROP-Training" must be applied on a filesystem of ROP-Training samples generated by the "dataGenerationROP.R" script.
* **Constants.** The "nbCombMin" is a constant defined inside the script which can be manually modified.
* **Warning.** The script doesn't handle the case where the ROP-Training sample doesn't exist.
